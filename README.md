### The Brief 
nb: Created, circa 2014

### Calculate difference between two dates.

#### Description:
Create an app, able to parse dates in the following format -
    
    DD MM YYYY, DD MM YYYY

#### Validation
Validate the input data, then calculate the diff between the two dates, in days.
Output of the application should be of the form -

    DD MM YYYY, DD MM YYYY, difference

Where the first date is the earliest, the second date is the latest and the difference is the number of days.
Input can be from a file, or from standard input, as the developer chooses.
Provide test data to exercise the application.

#### Constraints:
The application may not make use of the Java or other libraries for date manipulation (for example Date, Calendar classes).
The application can limit calculation on an input range of dates from 1900 to 2010

#### Deliverables:

An IDE importable java project including but not restricted to source files and test files
